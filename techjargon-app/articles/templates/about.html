                History of technology is changing at a rate it hasn’t ever been changed before. Even within a narrow domain of technology so many new things emerge everyday and there was no way to keep up to date with all these technologies. Most of the time, even without
                having expert knowledge on the matter but to have a meaningful discussion with someone who have a reasonable background about that subject matter allows you gain on social capital. So we thought there should be a place where individuals
                could find a definition for a technical term but not to spend much time reading it. Techjargon provide a list of trending terms in the domain so anyone interested could be up to date.
